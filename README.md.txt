# Kitchen Chaos

**Kitchen Chaos** is a **mini project** created as part of a class project, following tutorials from the **Code Monkey** YouTube channel. In this project, the code was modified based on the class teachings to deepen the understanding of game development concepts.

## Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with **Unity** and **C#** game development, following the steps outlined in the **Code Monkey** tutorial, while modifying the code to better understand and learn the development process.

## Changes Made in the Project:
Throughout the development of this project, several parts of the code were modified to add new features and change the game structure, differentiating it from the original version presented in the tutorial. These changes were made to help improve understanding and allow more practice with Unity and C# coding.
